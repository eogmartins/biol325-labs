Select all that apply.\n\nAnswerlist\n----------\n* P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(A)\n* P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(B)\n* P(A ∪ B) ≥ P(A)\n* P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) always\n\nSolution\n========\nIntersection is a subset of each event, so it cannot be larger than either P(A) or P(B). Union contains A, so it cannot be smaller than A. Union equals sum only when A and B are disjoint / mutually exclusive (i.e., no overlap).\n\nMeta-information\n================\nexname: Lec01 Easy mchoice 03\nextype: mchoice\nexsolution: 1110\nexshuffle: TRUE\n",
