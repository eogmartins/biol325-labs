Select all that apply.\n\nAnswerlist\n----------\n* A and B are likely dependent\n* A and B are certainly independent\n* If A occurs, B may become more likely\n* Knowing B occurred could provide information about whether A occurred\n\nSolution\n========\nDrying reduces habitat and can increase stress, crowding, and predation risk, so mortality may become more likely. That is **dependence**: learning A changes beliefs about B and vice‑versa. Independence is not automatic and it must be justified.\n\nMeta-information\n================\nexname: Lec01 Easy mchoice 01\nextype: mchoice\nexsolution: 1011\nexshuffle: TRUE\n",
