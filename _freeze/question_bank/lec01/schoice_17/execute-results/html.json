Historically, algal blooms (event B) have occurred in 35% of the lakes, so P(B) = 0.35.\n\nAmong lakes with high nutrient levels, 70% have algal blooms, so P(B | N) = 0.7.\n\nWhat is the probability that a lake has high nutrient levels given that it exhibits an algal bloom?\n\nAnswerlist\n----------\n* 0.2\n* 0.4\n* 0.6\n* 0.8\n\nSolution\n========\nYou are asked to find P(N | B). So, applying Bayes’ rule:\n\nP(N | B) = [P(B | N) × P(N)] / P(B)\n          = (0.7 × 0.4) / 0.35\n          = 0.8\n\nMeta-information\n================\nexname: Lec01 Bayes Easy schoice complements\nextype: schoice\nexsolution: 0001\nexshuffle: TRUE\n",
