The probability that amphibians are detected on a daily sample depends on the weather. Which statements could be true? Select all that apply.\n\nAnswerlist\n----------\n* Detecting amphibians in the two sampling days may be dependent because of weather effects\n* Sampling in different days guarantees independence\n* If weather conditions persist, P(detect sample 2 | detect sample 1 ) could be higher than P(detect sample 2)\n* Mutual exclusivity implies you cannot detect amphibians on both sampling days\n\nSolution\n========\nShared drivers (i.e., weather in this case) can create dependence across sampling days. Detecting amphibians on the first sampling day due good weather can indicate a high probability of detection on the second sampling day if weather conditions persist. Mutual exclusivity is not appropriate here because detecting in two consecutive days is possible.\n\nMeta-information\n================\nexname: Lec01 Medium mchoice 08\nextype: mchoice\nexsolution: 1010\nexshuffle: TRUE\n",
