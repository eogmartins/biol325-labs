Which interpretation is most appropriate under the frequentist definition of probability?\n\nAnswerlist\n----------\n* Exactly 65% of all quadrats always contain cattails\n* In the long run, about 65% of randomly sampled quadrats would contain cattails\n* There are exactly 65 cattails per quadrat\n* Cattails are guaranteed to be present in every wetland\n\nSolution\n========\nA probability like 0.65 describes **uncertainty** and is often interpreted as a long‑run frequency by frequentists. That is, if you repeatedly sample many quadrats under similar conditions, you would expect cattails in about 65% of them **on average**. It does **not** mean you will get exactly 65% in every small sample, it does not describe abundance (how many cattails), and it does not guarantee they will be present in every wetland.\n\nMeta-information\n================\nexname: Lec01 Easy schoice 01\nextype: schoice\nexsolution: 0100\nexshuffle: TRUE\n",
