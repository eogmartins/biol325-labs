That is the Bayesian interpretation: probability is a **degree of belief** conditional on what you currently know.  \n\nA frequentist interpretation typically treats probability as a long‑run frequency under repeated identical trials. It does not assign probabilities to fixed but unknown hypotheses (like “this reach is occupied”) in the same way Bayesians do.\n\nMeta-information\n================\nexname: Lec01 Bayes schoice 16\nextype: schoice\nexsolution: 0100\nexshuffle: TRUE\n",
