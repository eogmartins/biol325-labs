Select all that apply.\n\nAnswerlist\n----------\n* Define events clearly before calculating probabilities\n* Avoid assuming independence without justification\n* Use complements/unions to avoid double-counting\n* Assume everything is independent to simplify\n\nSolution\n========\nGood practice is conceptual: define events, choose the correct rule, and justify assumptions.
