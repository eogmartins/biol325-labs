Among forested sites, 60% have a stream, so P(S | F) = 0.6. What is the probability that a site is forested given that it has a stream?\n\nAnswerlist\n----------\n* 0.1\n* 0.4\n* 0.5\n* 0.7\n\nSolution\n========\nYou are asked to find P(F | S). So, applying Bayes’ rule:\n\nP(F | S) = [P(S | F) × P(F)] / P(S)\n          = (0.6 × 0.5) / 0.75\n          = 0.4\n\nMeta-information\n================\nexname: Lec01 Bayes Easy schoice marginals\nextype: schoice\nexsolution: 0100\nexshuffle: TRUE\n",
