Select all that apply.\n\nAnswerlist\n----------\n* A and B could be dependent because forest microclimate supports moss\n* A and B must be independent because they are different attributes\n* P(A ∩ B) can be greater than P(A)\n* P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(A)\n\nSolution\n========\nDependence is plausible via dependence of moss on cool and humid microclimates, which can be provided by forests. The intersection cannot exceed either event, so P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(A).\n\nMeta-information\n================\nexname: Lec01 Hard mchoice 15\nextype: mchoice\nexsolution: 1001\nexshuffle: TRUE\n",
