Select all that apply.\n\nAnswerlist\n----------\n* P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B)\n* P(A) + P(B) if A and B are mutually exclusive\n* 1 − P((A ∪ B)ᶜ)\n* P(A P(B)\n\nSolution\n========\nGeneral addition rule subtracts overlap. If disjoint, overlap is 0 so it simplifies. You can also use the complement of the union. The product rule is for intersections under independence, not unions.\n\nMeta-information\n================\nexname: Lec01 Medium mchoice 07\nextype: mchoice\nexsolution: 1110\nexshuffle: TRUE\n",
