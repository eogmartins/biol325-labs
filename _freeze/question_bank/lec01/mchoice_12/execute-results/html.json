Select all that apply.\n\nAnswerlist\n----------\n* P(A ∪ B) = 0.7\n* A and B are independent\n* A and B are not mutually exclusive\n* P(A | B) = 0.8\n\nSolution\n========\nCompute union: 0.6 + 0.5 − 0.4 = 0.7. Independence would require 0.6 × 0.5 = 0.3, not 0.4. Intersection is not 0, so not mutually exclusive. Conditional: P(A | B) = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8.\n\nMeta-information\n================\nexname: Lec01 Hard mchoice 13\nextype: mchoice\nexsolution: 1011\nexshuffle: TRUE\n",
