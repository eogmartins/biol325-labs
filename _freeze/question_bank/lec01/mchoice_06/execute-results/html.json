Select all that apply.\n\nAnswerlist\n----------\n* P(A | B) < P(A)\n* A and B may be dependent\n* P(A | B) must equal P(A)\n* This automatically proves the species is absent when windy\n\nSolution\n========\nWind can make birds harder to hear/see, reducing detection probability. That means P(detect | windy) can be lower than overall P(detect), indicating dependence. But lower detection does not prove absence. Instead, it reflects the observation process.\n\nMeta-information\n================\nexname: Lec01 Medium mchoice 06\nextype: mchoice\nexsolution: 1100\nexshuffle: TRUE\n",
