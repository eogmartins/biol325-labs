If both days share conditions (weather, flow, observer, habitat), then learning about one day can change probabilities about the other. Independence must be justified by mechanism or design, not by calendar time. Independence has nothing to do with sample size or an event being rare.\n\nMeta-information\n================\nexname: Lec01 Medium schoice 10\nextype: schoice\nexsolution: 0100\nexshuffle: TRUE\n",
