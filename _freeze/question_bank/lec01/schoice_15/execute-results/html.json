Which statement is correct?\n\nAnswerlist\n----------\n* A and B are mutually exclusive\n* P(A ∪ B) = 0.6\n* A and B are independent because 0.3 × 0.7 = 0.21\n* P(A | B) = 0.4\n\nSolution\n========\nCompute the union using the addition rule: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B) = 0.3 + 0.7 − 0.4 = 0.6. They are not mutually exclusive (intersection is not 0). They are not independent (0.3 × 0.7 = 0.21, not 0.4). Also P(A | B) = 0.4 / 0.7 = 0.57, not 0.4.\n\nMeta-information\n================\nexname: Lec01 Hard schoice 15\nextype: schoice\nexsolution: 0100\nexshuffle: TRUE\n",
