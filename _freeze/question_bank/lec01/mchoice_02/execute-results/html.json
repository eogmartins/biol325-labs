Select all that apply.\n\nAnswerlist\n----------\n* Probabilities are non-negative\n* P(S) = 1 for sample space S (i.e., normalization)\n* P(A) + P(Aᶜ) = 1\n* P(A) can exceed 1 if A is common\n\nSolution\n========\nNon‑negativity and normalization are axioms. The complement rule gives P(A) + P(Aᶜ) = 1. Probabilities never exceed 1.\n\nMeta-information\n================\nexname: Lec01 Easy mchoice 02\nextype: mchoice\nexsolution: 1110\nexshuffle: TRUE\n",
