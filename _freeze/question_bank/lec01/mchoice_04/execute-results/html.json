Select all that apply.\n\nAnswerlist\n----------\n* A and Aᶜ cannot occur together\n* A ∪ Aᶜ equals the sample space\n* P(Aᶜ) = 1 − P(A)\n* A and Aᶜ are independent\n\nSolution\n========\nComplements are mutually exclusive (can't happen together) and exhaustive (one must happen), so their probabilities sum to 1. They are not independent unless P(A) = 0 or P(A) = 1, because knowing A occurred tells you Aᶜ did not occur.\n\nMeta-information\n================\nexname: Lec01 Easy mchoice 04\nextype: mchoice\nexsolution: 1110\nexshuffle: TRUE\n",
