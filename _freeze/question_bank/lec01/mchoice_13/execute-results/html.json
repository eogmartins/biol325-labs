Select all that apply.\n\nAnswerlist\n----------\n* A ∩ B means A AND B\n* A ∪ B means A OR B (inclusive)\n* A ∪ B excludes cases where both occur\n* A ∩ B is always larger than A\n\nSolution\n========\nIntersection is AND. Union is inclusive OR (A, B, or both). Union does not exclude overlap. Intersection is a subset of A, so it cannot be larger than A.\n\nMeta-information\n================\nexname: Lec01 Hard mchoice 14\nextype: mchoice\nexsolution: 1100\nexshuffle: TRUE\n",
