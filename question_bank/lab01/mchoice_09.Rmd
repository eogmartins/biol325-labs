Question
========
Which are good ways to create a project-relative path to a file such as `data/penguins.csv`? Select all that apply.

Answerlist
----------
* `"data/penguins.csv"`
* `file.path("data", "penguins.csv")`
* `"C:/Users/name/course/data/penguins.csv"`
* `paste("data/", "penguins.csv", sep = "")`

Solution
========
Relative paths and `file.path()` are portable. `paste()` works but can be less robust across OS separators; `file.path()` is best practice. Absolute paths are not portable.
