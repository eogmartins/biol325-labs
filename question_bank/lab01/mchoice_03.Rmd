Question
========
Which practices help keep your analysis reproducible? Select all that apply.

Answerlist
----------
* Using an RStudio Project
* Using relative paths like `data/file.csv`
* Hard-coding the working directory as`setwd("C:/Users/.../")` in scripts
* Keeping raw data files in a stable folder within the project

Solution
========
Projects, relative paths, and stable data locations make it easy to re-run your analyses. Hard-coded paths defined by `setwd()`are typically not portable between computers.
