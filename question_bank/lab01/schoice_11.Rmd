Question
========
Which statement best describes why `setwd()` inside scripts is discouraged?

Answerlist
----------
* It is slower than relative paths.
* It can silently point to the wrong folder on someone else’s computer.
* It prevents using vectors in R.
* It breaks the Console.

Solution
========
`setwd()` hard-codes assumptions about file locations. In a project workflow, you should rely on the project root and relative paths so your code works for others and on other machines.
