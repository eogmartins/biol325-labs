Question
========
Which statements about matrices in R are true? Select all that apply.

Answerlist
----------
* Matrices are have a `dim` attribute.
* Matrices can be indexed with `[row, col]`.
* `length(m)` gives the number of elements in the matrix.
* Matrices can contain multiple data types in different columns like a data frame.

Solution
========
A matrix has two dimensions. You can index it with `[row, col]`, whereas `length()` counts all of its elements. Mixed types per column are not allowed in matrices, only in data frames.
