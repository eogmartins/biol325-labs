Question
========
Which approach is most reproducible when reading data in a project?

Answerlist
----------
* Clicking Import Dataset in RStudio every time
* Storing files in random locations and using absolute paths
* Putting data in a folder named `data/` and using relative paths in code
* Renaming files each time you run the analysis

Solution
========
Putting data inside a data folder (e.g., `data/`) nested in the project folder and using relative paths means your analysis can be re-run reliably, shared, and version controlled.
