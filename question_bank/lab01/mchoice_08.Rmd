Question
========
Which calls will return `NA` without additional arguments? Select all that apply.

Answerlist
----------
* `mean(c(1, NA, 3))`
* `sum(c(1, NA, 3))`
* `sum(c(1, 2, 3))`
* `length(c(1, NA, 3))`

Solution
========
Summaries often return `NA` if `NA` is present unless `na.rm = TRUE`. `length()` counts entries including `NA`, so it returns 3 (not `NA`).
