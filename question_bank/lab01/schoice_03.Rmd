Question
========
You have an RStudio Project with a `data/` folder. Which path is **portable** across computers if you share your RStudio project with a colleague?

Answerlist
----------
* C:/Users/Eduardo/Desktop/course/data/penguins.csv
* /Users/eduardo/Desktop/course/data/penguins.csv
* data/penguins.csv
* penguins.csv

Solution
========
`data/penguins.csv` is a relative path within the project, so it works as long as the same project structure exists in different computers. Absolute paths (starting with a drive letter or `/Users/...`) typically break on other computers.
