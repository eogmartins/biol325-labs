Question
========
Why is assuming independence often risky in ecology?

Answerlist
----------
* Because probabilities cannot be estimated in ecology
* Because ecological processes are often linked by mechanisms
* Because independence always reduces probabilities
* Because independence violates axioms

Solution
========
Ecological variables are frequently connected by causal pathways (temperature ↔ DO, habitat ↔ survival, predators ↔ prey). Independence is a strong simplifying assumption. When it fails, calculations like P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B) can be seriously misleading.
