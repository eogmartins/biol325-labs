Question
========
Which are valid ways to compute P(A ∪ B)? Select all that apply.

Answerlist
----------
* P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B)
* P(A) + P(B) if A and B are mutually exclusive
* 1 − P((A ∪ B)ᶜ)
* P(A P(B)

Solution
========
General addition rule subtracts overlap. If disjoint, overlap is 0 so it simplifies. You can also use the complement of the union. The product rule is for intersections under independence, not unions.
