Question
========
An ecologist says: 

“Before I collect new data, I can still assign a probability that a stream reach is occupied by bull trout based on prior surveys and expert knowledge.” 

This statement aligns most closely with which definition of probability?

Answerlist
----------
* Frequentist: probability is the long-run relative frequency of outcomes in repeated trials
* Bayesian: probability represents a degree of belief given current information
* Frequentist: probability must be 0 or 1 before data are collected
* Bayesian: probability cannot be updated with data

Solution
========
The statement is explicitly about assigning probability **before** collecting new data using existing information and expert knowledge. That is the Bayesian interpretation: probability is a **degree of belief** conditional on what you currently know.  

A frequentist interpretation typically treats probability as a long‑run frequency under repeated identical trials. It does not assign probabilities to fixed but unknown hypotheses (like “this reach is occupied”) in the same way Bayesians do.
