Question
========
If A and B are mutually exclusive and both have positive probability, which are true? Select all that apply.

Answerlist
----------
* P(A ∩ B) = 0
* P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)
* A and B cannot be independent
* P(A | B) = P(A)

Solution
========
Disjoint events have zero overlap and additive union. With positive probabilities, independence would require P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B) > 0, which contradicts the fact that disjoint events have no overlap; so they cannot be independent. P(A | B) must be 0 if B occurs because A and B are disjoint.
