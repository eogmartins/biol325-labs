Question
========
A researcher studying amphibian occurrence samples a wetland in two consecutive days. The probability that amphibians are detected on a daily sample depends on the weather. Which statements could be true? Select all that apply.

Answerlist
----------
* Detecting amphibians in the two sampling days may be dependent because of weather effects
* Sampling in different days guarantees independence
* If weather conditions persist, P(detect sample 2 | detect sample 1 ) could be higher than P(detect sample 2)
* Mutual exclusivity implies you cannot detect amphibians on both sampling days

Solution
========
Shared drivers (i.e., weather in this case) can create dependence across sampling days. Detecting amphibians on the first sampling day due good weather can indicate a high probability of detection on the second sampling day if weather conditions persist. Mutual exclusivity is not appropriate here because detecting in two consecutive days is possible.
