Question
========
In a landscape study 50% of sites are forested (event F, so P(F) = 0.5) and 75% of sites have a stream  (event S, so P(S) = 0.75). Among forested sites, 60% have a stream, so P(S | F) = 0.6. What is the probability that a site is forested given that it has a stream?

Answerlist
----------
* 0.1
* 0.4
* 0.5
* 0.7

Solution
========
You are asked to find P(F | S). So, applying Bayes’ rule:

P(F | S) = [P(S | F) × P(F)] / P(S)
          = (0.6 × 0.5) / 0.75
          = 0.4
