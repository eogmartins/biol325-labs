Question
========
In an ecological sampling scenario, P(A) = P(detect sample 1) = 0.4 and P(B) = P(detect sample 2) = 0.4. Assuming independence, compute P(detect in both samples).

Solution
========
Under independence: P(A ∩ B) = 0.4 × 0.4 = 0.16. In practice, subsequent sampling events may be dependent, but the arithmetic illustrates the product rule.
