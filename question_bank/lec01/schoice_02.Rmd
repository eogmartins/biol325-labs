Question
========
In a nest monitoring project, event A = “the nest is predated this season.” If P(A) = 0.30, what does the complement event Aᶜ represent?

Answerlist
----------
* The nest is present
* The nest is *not* predated this season
* The nest is successful
* The predator is absent from the region

Solution
========
Aᶜ is “not A.” So Aᶜ means **no predation** in that season.  
NOTE: “not predated” is not automatically the same as “successful” unless you define success as “not predated” (you might also have abandonment, wildfires, etc.). Clear event definitions matter.
