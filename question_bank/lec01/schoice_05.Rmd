Question
========
Two events are independent if:

Answerlist
----------
* They cannot occur together
* Knowing one occurred gives no information about the other
* They have equal probability
* Their probabilities sum to 1

Solution
========
Independence is about **no change in probability** when you learn information: P(A | B) = P(A). Independent events can co‑occur; it is mutually exclusive events that cannot. Equal probabilities or summing to 1 are not definitions of independence.
