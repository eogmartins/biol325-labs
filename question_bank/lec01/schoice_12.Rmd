Question
========
If P(A | B) > P(A), what does that suggest?

Answerlist
----------
* B makes A less likely
* B provides information that increases the probability of A
* A and B must be mutually exclusive
* A and B must be independent

Solution
========
Knowing B increases the probability that A happens. It does not imply mutual exclusivity, and it contradicts independence.
