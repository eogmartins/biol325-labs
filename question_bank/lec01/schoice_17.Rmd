Question
========
In a set of lakes, 40% have high nutrient levels (event N), so P(N) = 0.4. Historically, algal blooms (event B) have occurred in 35% of the lakes, so P(B) = 0.35.

Among lakes with high nutrient levels, 70% have algal blooms, so P(B | N) = 0.7.

What is the probability that a lake has high nutrient levels given that it exhibits an algal bloom?

Answerlist
----------
* 0.2
* 0.4
* 0.6
* 0.8

Solution
========
You are asked to find P(N | B). So, applying Bayes’ rule:

P(N | B) = [P(B | N) × P(N)] / P(B)
          = (0.7 × 0.4) / 0.35
          = 0.8
