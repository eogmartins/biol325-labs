Question
========
Which statement is an axiom (always true) in probability theory?

Answerlist
----------
* Probabilities can be negative for rare events
* The probability of the sample space is 1
* Probabilities must sum to 0 across events
* Probabilities depend on measurement units

Solution
========
One axiom is **normalization**: if S is the sample space (all possible outcomes), then P(S)=1. Other axioms include non‑negativity (P(A) ≥ 0) and additivity for disjoint events. Units matter for measurements (e.g., °C vs °F), but not for probability axioms.
