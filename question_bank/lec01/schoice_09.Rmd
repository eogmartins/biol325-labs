Question
========
A snorkel survey defines A = “juvenile salmon observed” and B = “water temperature > 20°C at survey time.” Which interpretation is correct?

Answerlist
----------
* P(B | A) is the probability juveniles are observed given T > 20°C
* P(A | B) is the probability juveniles are observed given T > 20°C
* P(A ∪ B) is the probability juveniles are observed and T > 20°C
* P(A ∩ B) is the probability juveniles are observed or T > 20°C

Solution
========
P(A | B) reads “A given B.” Here: probability of observing juveniles **given** temperature exceeds 20°C. Be careful with symbols: ∩ means AND, ∪ means OR (inclusive). This is a common source of mistakes.
