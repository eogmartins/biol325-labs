Question
========
In a fish survey, event A = “a randomly selected captured fish is female.” If P(A) = 0.40, what is P(Aᶜ)?

Answerlist
----------
* 0.40
* 0.60
* 1.40
* 0.00

Solution
========
Use the complement rule: P(Aᶜ) = 1 − P(A) = 1 − 0.40 = 0.60.  
Interpretation: in the long run, about 60% of captured fish would be non‑female under the same sampling process (not necessarily in every sample).
