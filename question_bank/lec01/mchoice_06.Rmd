Question
========
In a bird point-count, wind reduces detectability. Let A = “species detected”, B = “windy”. Which statements are plausible? Select all that apply.

Answerlist
----------
* P(A | B) < P(A)
* A and B may be dependent
* P(A | B) must equal P(A)
* This automatically proves the species is absent when windy

Solution
========
Wind can make birds harder to hear/see, reducing detection probability. That means P(detect | windy) can be lower than overall P(detect), indicating dependence. But lower detection does not prove absence. Instead, it reflects the observation process.
