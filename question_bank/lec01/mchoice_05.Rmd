Question
========
Which conditions imply independence? Select all that apply.

Answerlist
----------
* P(A | B) = P(A)
* P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B)
* P(B | A) = P(B)
* P(A ∩ B) = 0

Solution
========
The first three are equivalent characterizations of independence (when defined).
P(A ∩ B) = 0 is mutual exclusivity, not independence unless one event has probability 0.
