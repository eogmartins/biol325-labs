Question
========
Which are always true for any events A and B? Select all that apply.

Answerlist
----------
* P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(A)
* P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(B)
* P(A ∪ B) ≥ P(A)
* P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) always

Solution
========
Intersection is a subset of each event, so it cannot be larger than either P(A) or P(B). Union contains A, so it cannot be smaller than A. Union equals sum only when A and B are disjoint / mutually exclusive (i.e., no overlap).
