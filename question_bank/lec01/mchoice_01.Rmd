Question
========
A stream dries during summer (event A) and juvenile salmon experience mortality (event B). Which statements are reasonable? Select all that apply.

Answerlist
----------
* A and B are likely dependent
* A and B are certainly independent
* If A occurs, B may become more likely
* Knowing B occurred could provide information about whether A occurred

Solution
========
Drying reduces habitat and can increase stress, crowding, and predation risk, so mortality may become more likely. That is **dependence**: learning A changes beliefs about B and vice‑versa. Independence is not automatic and it must be justified.
