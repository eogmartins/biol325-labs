Question
========
Suppose P(A) = 0.6, P(B) = 0.5, P(A ∩ B) = 0.4. Which statements are true? Select all that apply.

Answerlist
----------
* P(A ∪ B) = 0.7
* A and B are independent
* A and B are not mutually exclusive
* P(A | B) = 0.8

Solution
========
Compute union: 0.6 + 0.5 − 0.4 = 0.7. Independence would require 0.6 × 0.5 = 0.3, not 0.4. Intersection is not 0, so not mutually exclusive. Conditional: P(A | B) = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8.
