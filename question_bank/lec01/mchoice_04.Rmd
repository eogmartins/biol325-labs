Question
========
Which statements correctly describe complements? Select all that apply.

Answerlist
----------
* A and Aᶜ cannot occur together
* A ∪ Aᶜ equals the sample space
* P(Aᶜ) = 1 − P(A)
* A and Aᶜ are independent

Solution
========
Complements are mutually exclusive (can't happen together) and exhaustive (one must happen), so their probabilities sum to 1. They are not independent unless P(A) = 0 or P(A) = 1, because knowing A occurred tells you Aᶜ did not occur.
