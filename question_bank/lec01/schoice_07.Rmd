Question
========
If events A and B are mutually exclusive, which statement is true?

Answerlist
----------
* P(A ∩ B) = 0
* P(A | B) = P(A)
* A and B must be independent
* P(A) = P(B)

Solution
========
Mutually exclusive means **cannot happen together**, so the overlap is zero: P(A ∩ B) = 0. They are **not independent** unless one event has probability 0.
