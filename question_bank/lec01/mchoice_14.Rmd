Question
========
In a habitat survey, A = “site is in forest”, B = “site has moss present”. Which statements are plausible? Select all that apply.

Answerlist
----------
* A and B could be dependent because forest microclimate supports moss
* A and B must be independent because they are different attributes
* P(A ∩ B) can be greater than P(A)
* P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(A)

Solution
========
Dependence is plausible via dependence of moss on cool and humid microclimates, which can be provided by forests. The intersection cannot exceed either event, so P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(A).
