Question
========
Which statements are consistent with probability axioms (foundational statements) and rules (derivations fom axioms)? Select all that apply.

Answerlist
----------
* Probabilities are non-negative
* P(S) = 1 for sample space S (i.e., normalization)
* P(A) + P(Aᶜ) = 1
* P(A) can exceed 1 if A is common

Solution
========
Non‑negativity and normalization are axioms. The complement rule gives P(A) + P(Aᶜ) = 1. Probabilities never exceed 1.
