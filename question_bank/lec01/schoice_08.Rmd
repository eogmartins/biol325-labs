Question
========
Which statement is always true for any events A and B?

Answerlist
----------
* P(A ∩ B) ≥ P(A)
* P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(A)
* P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) always
* P(A | B) > 1

Solution
========
The intersection (A∩B) is a subset of A, so it cannot be more probable than A: P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(A). The union equals the sum only when events are disjoint. Probabilities cannot exceed 1.
