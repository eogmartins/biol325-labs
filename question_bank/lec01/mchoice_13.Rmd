Question
========
Which statements about “AND” vs “OR” are correct? Select all that apply.

Answerlist
----------
* A ∩ B means A AND B
* A ∪ B means A OR B (inclusive)
* A ∪ B excludes cases where both occur
* A ∩ B is always larger than A

Solution
========
Intersection is AND. Union is inclusive OR (A, B, or both). Union does not exclude overlap. Intersection is a subset of A, so it cannot be larger than A.
