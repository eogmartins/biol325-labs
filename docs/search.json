    "text": "Some questions below will require you to do calculations. Enter only the numeric result in the answer field.\n\n\nWhich are good practice habits when using probability in ecology? Select all that apply.\n\nAssume everything is independent to simplifyDefine events clearly before calculating probabilitiesAvoid assuming independence without justificationUse complements/unions to avoid double-counting\n\n\n\nGood practice is conceptual: define events, choose the correct rule, and justify assumptions. Unjustified independence can badly mislead inference.\n\n\n\n\nDuring a salmon count, 12 of 48 fish are Chinook salmon. Estimate P(Chinook) using relative frequency.\n\n\n\nRelative frequency estimate is count / total = 12 / 48 = 0.25. This is an empirical estimate that would stabilize with larger samples.\n\n\n\n\nGiven P(A | B) = 0.30 and P(B) = 0.20, compute P(A ∩ B).\n\n\n\nMultiplication rule: P(A ∩ B) = P(A|B)P(B) = 0.30 × 0.20 = 0.06.\n\n\n\n\nIf P(A ∪ B) = 1, compute P((A ∪ B)ᶜ).\n\n\n\nIf union covers the whole sample space (i.e., P(A ∪ B) = 1), its complement is impossible, so P((A ∪ B)ᶜ) = 0.\n\n\n\n\nWhat do we call the set of all possible outcomes?\n\n\n\nThe sample space contains all possible outcomes for the process you are modeling (e.g., {detected, not detected} for one sample).\n\n\n\n\nIf A and B are mutually exclusive and both have positive probability, which are true? Select all that apply.\n\nP(A ∩ B) = 0A and B cannot be independentP(A | B) = P(A)P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)\n\n\n\nDisjoint events have zero overlap and additive union. With positive probabilities, independence would require P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B) &gt; 0, which contradicts the fact that disjoint events have no overlap; so they cannot be independent. P(A | B) must be 0 if B occurs because A and B are disjoint.\n\n\n\n\nIf P(A) = 1, compute P(Aᶜ).\n\n\n\nA is a certain event, so complement impossible: P(Aᶜ) = 1 − P(A) = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\n\n\n\nIn an ecological sampling scenario, P(A) = P(detect sample 1) = 0.4 and P(B) = P(detect sample 2) = 0.4. Assuming independence, compute P(detect in both samples).\n\n\n\nUnder independence: P(A ∩ B) = 0.4 × 0.4 = 0.16. In practice, subsequent sampling events may be dependent, but the arithmetic illustrates the product rule.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the term for ‘not A’?\n\n\n\nThe complement of A (or Aᶜ), is the event that A does not occur.\n\n\n\n\nTwo events are independent if:\n\nThey cannot occur togetherKnowing one occurred gives no information about the otherTheir probabilities sum to 1They have equal probability\n\n\n\nIndependence is about no change in probability when you learn information: P(A | B) = P(A). Independent events can co‑occur; it is mutually exclusive events that cannot. Equal probabilities or summing to 1 are not definitions of independence.\n\n\n\n\nWhich statements about “AND” vs “OR” are correct? Select all that apply.\n\nA ∩ B means A AND BA ∪ B excludes cases where both occurA ∪ B means A OR B (inclusive)A ∩ B is always larger than A\n\n\n\nIntersection is AND. Union is inclusive OR (A, B, or both). Union does not exclude overlap. Intersection is a subset of A, so it cannot be larger than A.\n\n\n\n\nWhat word indicates conditioning in a probability statement?\n\n\n\nThe word given signals conditional probability, like P(A | B) = probability of A given B.\n\n\n\n\nIn a bird point-count, P(detect) = 0.65. Compute P(not detect).\n\n\n\nUse complement rule: 1 − 0.65 = 0.35.\n\n\n\n\nIn a bird point-count, wind reduces detectability. Let A = “species detected”, B = “windy”. Which statements are plausible? Select all that apply.\n\nA and B may be dependentThis automatically proves the species is absent when windyP(A | B) &lt; P(A)P(A | B) must equal P(A)\n\n\n\nWind can make birds harder to hear/see, reducing detection probability. That means P(detect | windy) can be lower than overall P(detect), indicating dependence. But lower detection does not prove absence. Instead, it reflects the observation process.\n\n\n\n\nA stream dries during summer (event A) and juvenile salmon experience mortality (event B). Which statements are reasonable? Select all that apply.\n\nIf A occurs, B may become more likelyKnowing B occurred could provide information about whether A occurredA and B are likely dependentA and B are certainly independent\n\n\n\nDrying reduces habitat and can increase stress, crowding, and predation risk, so mortality may become more likely. That is dependence: learning A changes beliefs about B and vice‑versa. Independence is not automatic and it must be justified.\n\n\n\n\nYou know P(A) = 0.3, P(B) = 0.7, and P(A ∩ B) = 0.4. Which statement is correct?\n\nP(A | B) = 0.4P(A ∪ B) = 0.6A and B are mutually exclusiveA and B are independent because 0.3 × 0.7 = 0.21\n\n\n\nCompute the union using the addition rule: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B) = 0.3 + 0.7 − 0.4 = 0.6. They are not mutually exclusive (intersection is not 0). They are not independent (0.3 × 0.7 = 0.21, not 0.4). Also P(A | B) = 0.4 / 0.7 = 0.57, not 0.4.\n\n\n\n\nIf P(A | B) ≠ P(A), what is the relationship between A and B?\n\n\n\nIf conditioning on B changes the probability of A, then A and B are dependent (associated).\n\n\n\n\nA researcher says: “Because two events happen on different days, they must be independent.” What is the best response?\n\nCorrect — independence only depends on sample sizeIt depends only on whether events are rareCorrect — different days guarantees independenceIncorrect — independence is an assumption; shared drivers (e.g., environmentalc conditons) can create dependence\n\n\n\nDifferent days do not guarantee independence. If both days share conditions (weather, flow, observer, habitat), then learning about one day can change probabilities about the other. Independence must be justified by mechanism or design, not by calendar time. Independence has nothing to do with sample size or an event being rare.\n\n\n\n\nIn a landscape study 50% of sites are forested (event F, so P(F) = 0.5) and 75% of sites have a stream (event S, so P(S) = 0.75). Among forested sites, 60% have a stream, so P(S | F) = 0.6. What is the probability that a site is forested given that it has a stream?\n\n0.10.70.40.5\n\n\n\nYou are asked to find P(F | S). So, applying Bayes’ rule:\nP(F | S) = [P(S | F) × P(F)] / P(S) = (0.6 × 0.5) / 0.75 = 0.4\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the name of the rule P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A∩B)?\n\n\n\nAddition rule.\n\n\n\n\nIf P(A) = 0.7, what is the minimum possible value of P(A ∪ B)? HINT: it helps to draw Venn diagrams to come up with solution.\n\n\n\nUnion contains A, so it cannot be smaller than P(A). Minimum occurs when B is a subset of A.\n\n\n\n\nIf P(A | B) &gt; P(A), what does that suggest?\n\nB makes A less likelyA and B must be independentB provides information that increases the probability of AA and B must be mutually exclusive\n\n\n\nKnowing B increases the probability that A happens. It does not imply mutual exclusivity, and it contradicts independence.\n\n\n\n\nIf P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.3 and A and B are mutually exclusive, compute P(A ∪ B).\n\n\n\nFor disjoint events, union is additive: 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.5.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the term for events where knowing one occurred does not change the probability of the other?\n\n\n\nIndependent events means P(A | B) = P(A), equivalently P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B).\n\n\n\n\nWhich statement is an axiom (always true) in probability theory?\n\nProbabilities must sum to 0 across eventsThe probability of the sample space is 1Probabilities can be negative for rare eventsProbabilities depend on measurement units\n\n\n\nOne axiom is normalization: if S is the sample space (all possible outcomes), then P(S)=1. Other axioms include non‑negativity (P(A) ≥ 0) and additivity for disjoint events. Units matter for measurements (e.g., °C vs °F), but not for probability axioms.\n\n\n\n\nIn words, what does the symbol ∪ mean?\n\n\n\nA ∪ B is the union, that is outcomes where either A or B occurs.\n\n\n\n\nGiven P(A) = 0.6, P(B) = 0.5, P(A ∩ B) = 0.4, compute P(A ∪ B).\n\n\n\nUse addition rule for overlapping events: P(A ∪ B) = 0.6 + 0.5 − 0.4 = 0.7 (subtract overlap once to avoid double-counting).\n\n\n\n\nIf P(A) = 0.4, compute P(Aᶜ).\n\n\n\nComplement rule: 1 − 0.4 = 0.6.\n\n\n\n\nIn a fish survey, event A = “a randomly selected captured fish is female.” If P(A) = 0.40, what is P(Aᶜ)?\n\n0.400.001.400.60\n\n\n\nUse the complement rule: P(Aᶜ) = 1 − P(A) = 1 − 0.40 = 0.60.\nInterpretation: in the long run, about 60% of captured fish would be non‑female under the same sampling process (not necessarily in every sample).\n\n\n\n\nWhich statement is always true for any events A and B?\n\nP(A ∩ B) ≥ P(A)P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(A)P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) alwaysP(A | B) &gt; 1\n\n\n\nThe intersection (A∩B) is a subset of A, so it cannot be more probable than A: P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(A). The union equals the sum only when events are disjoint. Probabilities cannot exceed 1.\n\n\n\n\nGiven P(A ∩ B) = 0.12 and P(B) = 0.30, compute P(A | B).\n\n\n\nComputation: P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B) = 0.12 / 0.30 = 0.4.\n\n\n\n\nIn a nest monitoring project, event A = “the nest is predated this season.” If P(A) = 0.30, what does the complement event Aᶜ represent?\n\nThe nest is presentThe nest is not predated this seasonThe nest is successfulThe predator is absent from the region\n\n\n\nAᶜ is “not A.” So Aᶜ means no predation in that season.\nNOTE: “not predated” is not automatically the same as “successful” unless you define success as “not predated” (you might also have abandonment, wildfires, etc.). Clear event definitions matter.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose P(A ∩ B) = P(A). What does this imply about the relationship between A and B?\n\nWhenever A happens, B also happens (A ⊆ B)A and B are independentWhenever B happens, A also happens (B ⊆ A)A and B cannot co-occur\n\n\n\nIf the intersection equals P(A), then all of A is inside B (i.e., A ⊆ B).\nThat is, whenever A happens, B must also happen. This is a useful logical interpretation that can appear in ecological event definitions. For example, if A is “juvenile of sockeye” and B is “sockeye”, then A is a subset of B. If you sample a fish and it is a sockeye juvenile, then it is also certainly (i.e., P(B) = 1) a sockeye. It follows that P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B) = P(A).\n\n\n\n\nA snorkel survey defines A = “juvenile salmon observed” and B = “water temperature &gt; 20°C at survey time.” Which interpretation is correct?\n\nP(B | A) is the probability juveniles are observed given T &gt; 20°CP(A ∩ B) is the probability juveniles are observed or T &gt; 20°CP(A ∪ B) is the probability juveniles are observed and T &gt; 20°CP(A | B) is the probability juveniles are observed given T &gt; 20°C\n\n\n\nP(A | B) reads “A given B.” Here: probability of observing juveniles given temperature exceeds 20°C. Be careful with symbols: ∩ means AND, ∪ means OR (inclusive). This is a common source of mistakes.\n\n\n\n\nIn words, what does the symbol ∩ mean?\n\n\n\nA ∩ B is the intersection, that is outcomes where both A and B occur.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the term for two events that cannot occur together?\n\n\n\nMutually exclusive or disjoint events have no overlap: P(A ∩ B) = 0.\n\n\n\n\nLet P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.5. Without knowing whether the events overlap or not, what is the largest possible P(A ∪ B)?\n\n\n\nLargest union occurs when there is no overlap (disjoint events): 0.2 + 0.5 = 0.7.\n\n\n\n\nWhich are valid ways to compute P(A ∪ B)? Select all that apply.\n\nP(A P(B)P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B)1 − P((A ∪ B)ᶜ)P(A) + P(B) if A and B are mutually exclusive\n\n\n\nGeneral addition rule subtracts overlap. If disjoint, overlap is 0 so it simplifies. You can also use the complement of the union. The product rule is for intersections under independence, not unions.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the name of the rule P(Aᶜ) = 1 − P(A)?\n\n\n\nComplement rule.\n\n\n\n\nWhich are always true for any events A and B? Select all that apply.\n\nP(A ∪ B) ≥ P(A)P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(A)P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(B)P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) always\n\n\n\nIntersection is a subset of each event, so it cannot be larger than either P(A) or P(B). Union contains A, so it cannot be smaller than A. Union equals sum only when A and B are disjoint / mutually exclusive (i.e., no overlap).\n\n\n\n\nAn ecologist says:\n“Before I collect new data, I can still assign a probability that a stream reach is occupied by bull trout based on prior surveys and expert knowledge.”\nThis statement aligns most closely with which definition of probability?\n\nBayesian: probability cannot be updated with dataFrequentist: probability is the long-run relative frequency of outcomes in repeated trialsFrequentist: probability must be 0 or 1 before data are collectedBayesian: probability represents a degree of belief given current information\n\n\n\nThe statement is explicitly about assigning probability before collecting new data using existing information and expert knowledge. That is the Bayesian interpretation: probability is a degree of belief conditional on what you currently know.\nA frequentist interpretation typically treats probability as a long‑run frequency under repeated identical trials. It does not assign probabilities to fixed but unknown hypotheses (like “this reach is occupied”) in the same way Bayesians do.\n\n\n\n\nIf events A and B are mutually exclusive, which statement is true?\n\nP(A | B) = P(A)P(A ∩ B) = 0P(A) = P(B)A and B must be independent\n\n\n\nMutually exclusive means cannot happen together, so the overlap is zero: P(A ∩ B) = 0. They are not independent unless one event has probability 0.\n\n\n\n\nIn a salmon smolt study, you estimate P(survive | low flow) = 0.30 and P(survive) = 0.45. Which conclusion is most appropriate?\n\nSurvival is lower under low flow than overallLow flow increases survivalThis proves low flow causes mortalitySurvival and flow are independent\n\n\n\nCompare conditional to marginal probability: 0.30 &lt; 0.45, so survival appears less likely under low flow than overall. That implies association (dependence). However, it does not prove causation, as high flow could be correlated with other factors (timing, predators, turbidity). Probability comparisons identify patterns, whereas causal claims require mechanistic understanding and stronger design/analysis.\n\n\n\n\nA researcher studying amphibian occurrence samples a wetland in two consecutive days. The probability that amphibians are detected on a daily sample depends on the weather. Which statements could be true? Select all that apply.\n\nIf weather conditions persist, P(detect sample 2 | detect sample 1 ) could be higher than P(detect sample 2)Sampling in different days guarantees independenceMutual exclusivity implies you cannot detect amphibians on both sampling daysDetecting amphibians in the two sampling days may be dependent because of weather effects\n\n\n\nShared drivers (i.e., weather in this case) can create dependence across sampling days. Detecting amphibians on the first sampling day due good weather can indicate a high probability of detection on the second sampling day if weather conditions persist. Mutual exclusivity is not appropriate here because detecting in two consecutive days is possible.\n\n\n\n\nWhich statements correctly describe complements? Select all that apply.\n\nA ∪ Aᶜ equals the sample spaceA and Aᶜ are independentA and Aᶜ cannot occur togetherP(Aᶜ) = 1 − P(A)\n\n\n\nComplements are mutually exclusive (can’t happen together) and exhaustive (one must happen), so their probabilities sum to 1. They are not independent unless P(A) = 0 or P(A) = 1, because knowing A occurred tells you Aᶜ did not occur.\n\n\n\n\nWhich statements are consistent with probability axioms (foundational statements) and rules (derivations fom axioms)? Select all that apply.\n\nP(A) can exceed 1 if A is commonProbabilities are non-negativeP(S) = 1 for sample space S (i.e., normalization)P(A) + P(Aᶜ) = 1\n\n\n\nNon‑negativity and normalization are axioms. The complement rule gives P(A) + P(Aᶜ) = 1. Probabilities never exceed 1.\n\n\n\n\nIf A and B are independent and P(A) = 0.3, P(B) = 0.3, compute P(A ∩ B).\n\n\n\nUse product rule: 0.3 × 0.3 = 0.09.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose P(A) = 0.6, P(B) = 0.5, P(A ∩ B) = 0.4. Which statements are true? Select all that apply.\n\nP(A | B) = 0.8A and B are not mutually exclusiveP(A ∪ B) = 0.7A and B are independent\n\n\n\nCompute union: 0.6 + 0.5 − 0.4 = 0.7. Independence would require 0.6 × 0.5 = 0.3, not 0.4. Intersection is not 0, so not mutually exclusive. Conditional: P(A | B) = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8.\n\n\n\n\nYou survey a wetland and estimate that the probability a randomly chosen quadrat contains cattails is 0.65. Which interpretation is most appropriate under the frequentist definition of probability?\n\nCattails are guaranteed to be present in every wetlandIn the long run, about 65% of randomly sampled quadrats would contain cattailsExactly 65% of all quadrats always contain cattailsThere are exactly 65 cattails per quadrat\n\n\n\nA probability like 0.65 describes uncertainty and is often interpreted as a long‑run frequency by frequentists. That is, if you repeatedly sample many quadrats under similar conditions, you would expect cattails in about 65% of them on average. It does not mean you will get exactly 65% in every small sample, it does not describe abundance (how many cattails), and it does not guarantee they will be present in every wetland.\n\n\n\n\nWhich statements about conditional probability are correct? Select all that apply.\n\nIf independent, P(A | B) = P(A)It can be larger or smaller than the marginal probabilityIt uses information after the word ‘given’It always increases probability\n\n\n\nConditioning can increase or decrease probability depending on association. Independence means that conditioning does not change probabilities.\n\n\n\n\nIf P(A | B) = 0.6 and P(B) = 0.5, compute P(A ∩ B).\n\n\n\nMultiplication rule for dependent events: P(A ∩ B) = P(A | B)P(B) = 0.6 × 0.5 = 0.3.\n\n\n\n\nIn a habitat survey, A = “site is in forest”, B = “site has moss present”. Which statements are plausible? Select all that apply.\n\nP(A ∩ B) ≤ P(A)P(A ∩ B) can be greater than P(A)A and B could be dependent because forest microclimate supports mossA and B must be independent because they are different attributes\n\n\n\nDependence is plausible via dependence of moss on cool and humid microclimates, which can be provided by forests. The intersection cannot exceed either event, so P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(A).\n\n\n\n\nWhich conditions imply independence? Select all that apply.\n\nP(A ∩ B) = 0P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B)P(B | A) = P(B)P(A | B) = P(A)\n\n\n\nThe first three are equivalent characterizations of independence (when defined). P(A ∩ B) = 0 is mutual exclusivity, not independence unless one event has probability 0.\n\n\n\n\nIn a set of lakes, 40% have high nutrient levels (event N), so P(N) = 0.4. Historically, algal blooms (event B) have occurred in 35% of the lakes, so P(B) = 0.35.\nAmong lakes with high nutrient levels, 70% have algal blooms, so P(B | N) = 0.7.\nWhat is the probability that a lake has high nutrient levels given that it exhibits an algal bloom?\n\n0.20.80.40.6\n\n\n\nYou are asked to find P(N | B). So, applying Bayes’ rule:\nP(N | B) = [P(B | N) × P(N)] / P(B) = (0.7 × 0.4) / 0.35 = 0.8\n\n\n\n\nA researcher surveying pileated woodpeckers visits the same forest twice. Let A = “woodpecker detected on visit 2” and B = “woodpecker detected on visit 1.” Which statement best describes P(A | B)?\n\nProbability that both occurProbability of B given AProbability that neither occursProbability of A given B\n\n\n\nP(A | B) is the probability of A given B occurred.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the name of the rule P(A ∩ B) = P(A | B)P(B)?\n\n\n\nMultiplication rule.\n\n\n\n\nWhy is assuming independence often risky in ecology?\n\nBecause probabilities cannot be estimated in ecologyBecause ecological processes are often linked by mechanismsBecause independence violates axiomsBecause independence always reduces probabilities\n\n\n\nEcological variables are frequently connected by causal pathways (temperature ↔︎ DO, habitat ↔︎ survival, predators ↔︎ prey). Independence is a strong simplifying assumption. When it fails, calculations like P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B) can be seriously misleading."

Just keep in mind that if you’re trying to use a function from a package that you’re certain you have already installed, but get an error that the function doesn’t exist, it’s likely that you forgot to load the package…"

Scripts are how we conduct reproducible data analysis tasks because they record every step of your analysis, can be re-run later to reproduce results, and make it easier to debug and collaborate. Learn more about R scripts in Chapter 6 of R4DS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest coding practices\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with a header: name, date, purpose\nUse clear object names (e.g., penguins_csv, not df1)\nUse paths relative to the working directory (e.g., data/penguins.csv), never setwd()\nComment why you did something (not just what)\n\nComments can be added by using # before any text. R will ignore anything after #.\n\nUse one tidyverse verb per line in pipelines for readability\nUse spaces between either side of operators and after commas. For example, do this x &lt;- 5 * y + mean(z, na.rm = TRUE) rather than this x&lt;-5*y+mean(z,na.rm=TRUE)\n\nLearn more about good coding practices in Chapter 4 of R4DS."

    "text": "What is the last number produced by seq(2, 20, by = 3)?\n\n\n\nThe sequence is 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20. Because 20 is exactly reached, it is included.\n\n\n\n\nFor m &lt;- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2), what is m[2,2]?\n\n\n\nFilled by column, the matrix columns are (1,2), (3,4), (5,6). Row 2, column 2 is 4.\n\n\n\n\nIf m &lt;- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3), what is ncol(m)?\n\n\n\nThe command specifies a matrix with three rows. Since you have nine values to populate a 3-row matrix, it follows that the matrix must have three columns.\n\n\n\n\nWrite the indexing expression to get the last element of a vector x.\n\n\n\nThe last element is at position length(x), so x[length(x)] returns it.\n\n\n\n\nLet x &lt;- c(3, NA, 7). What is sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)?\n\n\n\nna.rm = TRUE removes missing values before summing: 3 + 7 = 10.\n\n\n\n\nWhich base R function makes a histogram?\n\n\n\nhist() is the function that draws a histogram using base R graphics.\n\n\n\n\nLet x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3). What is mean(x)?\n\n\n\nThe mean is (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2.\n\n\n\n\nIf you run x &lt;- c(2, 4, 6), what type of object is x?\n\na vectora lista data framea matrix\n\n\n\nc() combines values into a vector, s x is a vector.\n\n\n\n\nLet x &lt;- 1:10. What is sum(x)?\n\n\n\nThe sum 1+2+…+10 equals 55.\n\n\n\n\nLet x &lt;- c(10, 20, 30). What is length(x[x &gt; 15])?\n\n\n\nValues greater than 15 are 20 and 30, giving a vector of length 2.\n\n\n\n\nWhich of these are valid ways to create a numeric vector? Select all that apply.\n\nlist(1, 2, 3)c(1, 2, 3)seq(1, 3)matrix(1:3, nrow = 1)\n\n\n\nBoth c() and seq() create vectors. matrix() creates a matrix (even if 1-row). A list is not an atomic numeric vector.\n\n\n\n\nFor x &lt;- c(10, 20, 30), which expressions return 20? (Select all that apply)\n\nx[2]x[1]x[3]x[x == 20]\n\n\n\nIndex 2 is 20, and logical subsetting x == 20 returns 20. Indices 1 and 3 return 10 and 30.\n\n\n\n\nWhich objects are vectors in base R? Select all that apply.\n\nc(1, 2, 3)1:10c(\"a\", \"b\")matrix(1:6, nrow = 2)\n\n\n\nVectors include numeric/integer/character vectors (e.g., c(1,2,3), 1:10, c(\"a\",\"b\")). A matrix is a different class with two dimensions.\n\n\n\n\nWrite the base R function that creates a sequence with a chosen step size (e.g., by = 0.5).\n\n\n\nseq() is the function that you can use to create sequences with flexible start/end/step values.\n\n\n\n\nIn base R graphics, which function creates a scatterplot?\n\nhist()barplot()plot()boxplot()\n\n\n\nplot(x, y) is the standard base R scatterplot function when x and y are numeric vectors. hist() makes histograms, boxplot() boxplots, and barplot() bar charts.\n\n\n\n\nWhich expressions create sequences of values? Select all that apply.\n\nseq(1, 9, by = 2)rep(1, 5)1:5seq(1, 5)\n\n\n\n1:5 and seq() create sequences. rep() repeats values rather than stepping through a range.\n\n\n\n\nWhich base R function returns the number of rows of a matrix m?\n\n\n\nnrow() is the function that returns the number of rows in matrix (also works for data frames).\n\n\n\n\nWrite a base R expression that creates the integer sequence from 1 to 10 using a :.\n\n\n\n1:10 uses the colon operator to create an integer sequence from 1 to 10.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose x &lt;- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"). What does x[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)] return?\n\n“b”“a” “b” “c”“a” “c”TRUE FALSE TRUE\n\n\n\nLogical indexing keeps elements where the logical vector is TRUE. Here, it keeps elements 1 and 3, returning c(\"a\", \"c\").\n\n\n\n\nIn base R, if you call plot(1:5, 1:5), how many points are plotted?\n\n\n\nBoth x and y have length = 5, so five points are plotted.\n\n\n\n\nLet x &lt;- seq(0, 1, by = 0.25). How many numbers are produced?\n\n\n\nThe sequence is 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1. That is 5 numbers.\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the following are examples of missing values in R? Select all that apply.\n\nNA\"\" (empty string)NaNNULL\n\n\n\nNA is the standard missing value in R. NaN can arise from undefined numeric operations (e.g., 0/0). NULL means “no value” and \"\" is an empty string, not missing.\n\n\n\n\nYou have an RStudio Project with a data/ folder. Which path is portable across computers if you share your RStudio project with a colleague?\n\npenguins.csvC:/Users/Eduardo/Desktop/course/data/penguins.csvdata/penguins.csv/Users/eduardo/Desktop/course/data/penguins.csv\n\n\n\ndata/penguins.csv is a relative path within the project, so it works as long as the same project structure exists in different computers. Absolute paths (starting with a drive letter or /Users/...) typically break on other computers.\n\n\n\n\nWrite the function that changes the working directory.\n\n\n\nsetwd() is the function that changes the working directory for the current R session.\n\n\n\n\nWrite the base R command that reports how many elements a vector x has.\n\n\n\nlength(x) returns the number of elements in x.\n\n\n\n\nLet x &lt;- c(3, 5, 7, 9). What is length(x)?\n\n\n\nA vector with four entries has length 4. length() counts elements, not values.\n\n\n\n\nLet x &lt;- rep(5, times = 6). What is length(x)?\n\n\n\nrep(5, times = 6) repeats 5 six times.\n\n\n\n\nWhich statement about the R workspace is true?\n\nThe workspace is the set of objects currently in memory (Environment).The workspace is a folder on disk that always matches your working directory.The workspace is the same thing as the Console.The workspace is the same thing as your script file.\n\n\n\nIn R, the workspace refers to objects currently in memory (e.g., vectors, data frames) shown in the Environment tab of RStudio. Files live on disk; scripts are text files; the Console is where commands run.\n\n\n\n\nWhich code creates a 2×3 matrix?\n\nmatrix(1:6, nrow = 3, ncol = 2)matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)cbind(1:2, 3:4, 5:6)rbind(1:3, 4:6)\n\n\n\nmatrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3) creates 2 rows and 3 columns, filling down columns by default. The others either have different shapes or build the matrix by binding.\n\n\n\n\nWrite a function that lists files in the current working directory in base R.\n\n\n\ndir() or list.files() returns a character vector of file and folder names in the current directory (or a specified path).\n\n\n\n\nWhich function returns the current working directory?\n\nlist.files()getwd()dir.create()setwd()\n\n\n\ngetwd() returns the current working directory as a character string. setwd() changes it; list.files() lists contents; dir.create() creates a folder.\n\n\n\n\nFor m &lt;- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2), what does m[2, 3] return?\n\n5642\n\n\n\nThe matrix is filled by column: columns are (1,2), (3,4), (5,6). Row 2, column 3 is 6.\n\n\n\n\nWhat does seq(1, 9, by = 2) produce?\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91 3 5 7 92 4 6 81 4 7\n\n\n\nseq(1, 9, by = 2) starts at 1 and steps by 2 until it reaches 9: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n\n\n\n\nLet x &lt;- c(3, 5, 7, 9). What is x[3]?\n\n\n\nIndexing with [3] returns the third element of the vector, which is 7.\n\n\n\n\nWrite the base R plotting function used for a box plot.\n\n\n\nboxplot() is teh function that produces a box plot in base R when given a numeric and a categorical vector.\n\n\n\n\nWhich practices help keep your analysis reproducible? Select all that apply.\n\nHard-coding the working directory assetwd(\"C:/Users/.../\") in scriptsUsing relative paths like data/file.csvKeeping raw data files in a stable folder within the projectUsing an RStudio Project\n\n\n\nProjects, relative paths, and stable data locations make it easy to re-run your analyses. Hard-coded paths defined by setwd()are typically not portable between computers.\n\n\n\n\nWhich functions are from base R graphics? Select all that apply.\n\nhist()boxplot()plot()ggplot()\n\n\n\nplot(), hist(), and boxplot() are base R graphics. ggplot() is from ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\nWrite the base R function that returns the current working directory.\n\n\n\ngetwd() is the function returns the current working directory.\n\n\n\n\nWhich approach is most reproducible when reading data in a project?\n\nStoring files in random locations and using absolute pathsClicking Import Dataset in RStudio every timePutting data in a folder named data/ and using relative paths in codeRenaming files each time you run the analysis\n\n\n\nPutting data inside a data folder (e.g., data/) nested in the project folder and using relative paths means your analysis can be re-run reliably, shared, and version controlled.\n\n\n\n\nFor x &lt;- c(5, NA, 9), what is sum(x) by default?\n\n9NA145\n\n\n\nBy default, arithmetic with missing values returns NA because the sum is unknown unless you explicitly remove missing values using na.rm = TRUE.\n\n\n\n\nHow many elements are in matrix(1:12, nrow = 3)?\n\n\n\n1:12 has 12 values. The matrix reshapes them but does not change the total number of elements.\n\n\n\n\nWhat does x[2] return for x &lt;- c(10, 20, 30)?\n\n10c(20, 30)3020\n\n\n\nThe command indicates you want teh second element of c(10, 20, 30), so 20 would be returned.\n\n\n\n\nLet x &lt;- c(1, NA, 3). What is mean(x, na.rm=TRUE)?\n\n\n\nRemoving NA leaves 1 and 3. Mean is (1 + 3) / 2 = 2.\n\n\n\n\nWhich are good ways to create a project-relative path to a file such as data/penguins.csv? Select all that apply.\n\n\"data/penguins.csv\"paste(\"data/\", \"penguins.csv\", sep = \"\")file.path(\"data\", \"penguins.csv\")\"C:/Users/name/course/data/penguins.csv\"\n\n\n\nRelative paths and file.path() are portable. paste() works but can be less robust across OS separators; file.path() is best practice. Absolute paths are not portable.\n\n\n\n\nIf list.files() prints 0 filenames, how many files matched your criteria?\n\n\n\nAn empty result means zero files matched your criteria (or the directory is empty).\n\n\n\n\nIn R, the working directory is best described as\n\nthe default folder R uses to read/write files unless you it give a paththe folder where your Quarto file is savedthe folder where RStudio stores its settingsthe folder where R is installed\n\n\n\nThe working directory is the default location for file input/output when you use relative paths (e.g., read.csv(\"data/file.csv\")).\n\n\n\n\nWhich statements about matrices in R are true? Select all that apply.\n\nlength(m) gives the number of elements in the matrix.Matrices are have a dim attribute.Matrices can be indexed with [row, col].Matrices can contain multiple data types in different columns like a data frame.\n\n\n\nA matrix has two dimensions. You can index it with [row, col], whereas length() counts all of its elements. Mixed types per column are not allowed in matrices, only in data frames.\n\n\n\n\nWhich calls will return NA without additional arguments? (Select all that apply)\n\nsum(c(1, 2, 3))length(c(1, NA, 3))mean(c(1, NA, 3))sum(c(1, NA, 3))\n\n\n\nSummaries often return NA if NA is present unless na.rm = TRUE. length() counts entries including NA, so it returns 3 (not NA).\n\n\n\n\nWhich statement best describes why setwd() inside scripts is discouraged?\n\nIt prevents using vectors in R.It breaks the Console.It is slower than relative paths.It can silently point to the wrong folder on someone else’s computer.\n\n\n\nsetwd() hard-codes assumptions about file locations. In a project workflow, you should rely on the project root and relative paths so your code works for others and on other machines."
