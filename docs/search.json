Scripts are how we conduct reproducible data analysis tasks because they record every step of your analysis, can be re-run later to reproduce results, and make it easier to debug and collaborate. Learn more about R scripts in Chapter 6 of R4DS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest coding practices\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with a header: name, date, purpose\nUse clear object names (e.g., penguins_csv, not df1)\nUse paths relative to the working directory (e.g., data/penguins.csv), never setwd()\nComment why you did something (not just what)\n\nComments can be added by using # before any text. R will ignore anything after #.\n\nUse one tidyverse verb per line in pipelines for readability\nUse spaces between either side of operators and after commas. For example, do this x &lt;- 5 * y + mean(z, na.rm = TRUE) rather than this x&lt;-5*y+mean(z,na.rm=TRUE)\n\nLearn more about good coding practices in Chapter 4 of R4DS."
