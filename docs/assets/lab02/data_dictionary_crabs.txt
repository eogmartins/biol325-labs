Dataset: Pie Crab (Fiddler crab morphology and environment)

Source: U.S. Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network; distributed for 
teaching via the lterdatasampler R package

Study system:
Fiddler crabs sampled at salt marsh sites associated with the Plum Island 
Ecosystems (PIE) LTER, USA.

Study focus:
Variation in crab body size in relation to environmental conditions across marsh
sites during summer 2016.

Variables:
- date: Date the individual crab was sampled (YYYY-MM-DD)
- latitude: Latitude of the salt marsh sampling site (decimal degrees)
- site: Salt marsh sampling site identifier (character)
- size: Crab body size (carapace width, mm)
- air_temp: Mean annual air temperature at the smapling site (°C)
- air_temp_sd: Standard deviation of mean annual air temperature (°C)
- longitude: Longitude of the sampling site (decimal degrees)
- time: Time of sampling (local time; HH:MM)
- water_temp: Mean annual water surface (< 1m) temperature
- water_temp_sd: Standard deviation of mean annual water surface (< 1m) temperature
- name: full name of research site
